# What is Data Breach?
> A data breach is a security violation, in which sensitive, protected or confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen or used by an individual unauthorized to do so.There are mainly 3 types of data breaches :
* __Physical Breach :__ A physical breach involves the physical theft of documents or equipment containing cardholder account data such as cardholder receipts, files, PCs, and POS systems.
* __Electronic Breach :__ An electronic breach is an unauthorized access or deliberate attack on a system or network environment where cardholder data is processed, stored, or transmitted.
* __Skimming :__ Skimming involves the capture and recording of magnetic stripe data on the back of credit cards. This process uses an external device that is sometimes installed on a merchantâ€™s POS without their knowledge. These identity thieves collect data and use it to create counterfeit credit and debit cards.

# What is Cyber Security and why is it important?
> Cyber security refers to protecting systems connected to the internet from threats in cyberspace. It involves protecting software, data, and hardware and helps prevent cybercriminals from gaining access to devices or the networks.

__Importance of Cyber Security :__ The importance of cyber security comes down to the desire to keep information, data, and devices private and safe.If a cybercriminal was to gain access to this data, they could cause a range of problems. They could share sensitive information, use passwords to steal funds, or even change data so that it benefits them in some way._Companies need cyber security to keep their data, finances, and intellectual property safe._

# About the Project
